"""NCAA field template — canonical pixel-to-yard landmark coordinates (Issue #127).

The homography stack maps pixel coordinates to a standardized field frame:

  X: 0 → 100 yards (goal line to goal line, excluding end zones)
  Y: -26.665 → +26.665 yards (south sideline → north sideline)

These are *NCAA-standard* field dimensions, not Toledo-specific constants —
a 53.33 yd (160 ft) wide field with inbound hash marks 40 ft from each
sideline. The values are exposed as a dataclass so a venue with non-standard
markings can supply an override without editing call sites; nothing here is
keyed to a single stadium.
