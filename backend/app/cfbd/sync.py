"""Idempotent CFBD → Postgres ingestion for Toledo + MAC (Issue #162).

Each endpoint sync upserts into its cache table (so re-running is safe and
non-destructive) and records a :class:`~app.cfbd.models.CFBDSyncRun` row with the
endpoint, params, timestamps, row counts, status, and a safe error summary.
Endpoint syncs are independent: if one fails the others still run and previously
cached data stays queryable, so analytics keep working when CFBD is degraded.

No vendor key is ever written here — the key lives only on the in-memory
``CFBDClient`` and is never part of a sync-run record or log line.
