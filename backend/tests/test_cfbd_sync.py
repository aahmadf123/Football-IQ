"""Integration tests for CFBD → Postgres ingestion (Issue #162).

These exercise the real upsert path against the configured Postgres (the same
DB the rest of the suite and CI use), creating only the CFBD cache tables so we
can assert idempotency, sync-run tracking, partial-failure isolation, and that
cached data is queryable without any further CFBD call.
